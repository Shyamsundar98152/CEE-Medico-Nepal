From $v_{max} = at_1$, $t_1 = v_{max}/a$. From $v_{max} = bt_2$, $t_2 = v_{max}/b$. Substituting these into $T = t_1 + t_2$, we get $T = v_{max}/a + v_{max}/b = v_{max} (\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}) = v_{max} (\frac{a+b}{ab})$. Therefore, $v_{max} = \frac{abT}{a+b}$."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "While the speed is constant, the direction of velocity continuously changes in circular motion, so velocity is not constant. Due to the change in direction of velocity, there is a centripetal acceleration, so acceleration is not zero. Kinetic energy depends only on mass and speed ($1/2 mv^2$), both of which are constant, so kinetic energy is constant. Momentum ($mv$) changes its direction, so it's not constant."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Escape velocity $v_e = \sqrt{2GM/R}$. Mass M can be written as density $\rho$ times volume $(4/3)\pi R^3$. So $M = \rho (4/3)\pi R^3$. Substituting this into the escape velocity formula, $v_e = \sqrt{2G\rho(4/3)\pi R^3 / R} = \sqrt{(8/3)G\rho\pi R^2} = R\sqrt{(8/3)G\rho\pi}$. Thus, $v_e \propto R$.
