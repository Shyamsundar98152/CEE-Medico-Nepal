  {
    "question": "1. Which of the following is an example of a physical change?",
    "options": [
      "A) Burning of wood",
      "B) Rusting of iron",
      "C) Dissolving salt in water",
      "D) Digestion of food"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Dissolving salt in water is a physical change because the chemical composition of salt and water remains unchanged, and they can be separated by physical means (e.g., evaporation). Burning, rusting, and digestion are chemical changes as new substances are formed."
  },
  {
    "question": "2. What is the pH of a neutral solution at 25°C?",
    "options": [
      "A) 0",
      "B) 7",
      "C) 14",
      "D) Depends on temperature"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "At 25°C, a neutral solution (like pure water) has an equal concentration of hydrogen and hydroxide ions, resulting in a pH of 7. Values below 7 are acidic, and above 7 are basic."

From $v_{max} = at_1$, $t_1 = v_{max}/a$. From $v_{max} = bt_2$, $t_2 = v_{max}/b$. Substituting these into $T = t_1 + t_2$, we get $T = v_{max}/a + v_{max}/b = v_{max} (\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}) = v_{max} (\frac{a+b}{ab})$. Therefore, $v_{max} = \frac{abT}{a+b}$."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "While the speed is constant, the direction of velocity continuously changes in circular motion, so velocity is not constant. Due to the change in direction of velocity, there is a centripetal acceleration, so acceleration is not zero. Kinetic energy depends only on mass and speed ($1/2 mv^2$), both of which are constant, so kinetic energy is constant. Momentum ($mv$) changes its direction, so it's not constant."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Escape velocity $v_e = \sqrt{2GM/R}$. Mass M can be written as density $\rho$ times volume $(4/3)\pi R^3$. So $M = \rho (4/3)\pi R^3$. Substituting this into the escape velocity formula, $v_e = \sqrt{2G\rho(4/3)\pi R^3 / R} = \sqrt{(8/3)G\rho\pi R^2} = R\sqrt{(8/3)G\rho\pi}$. Thus, $v_e \propto R$.
